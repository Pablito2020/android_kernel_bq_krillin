# Daredevil Project for Krillin

![Daredevil](http://s24.postimg.org/snrt08gut/image.png "Daredevil Kernel logo")

# Kernel compatible roms:

  * Lineage OS 13.0 Unofficial
  
  * Lineage OS 14.1 Unofficial

# Compilation guide:
  
  * First, made a folder for the kernel and enter to it:

        $ mkdir kernel

        $ cd kernel

  * Then, clone the project: 

        $ https://github.com/Pablito2020/android_kernel_bq_krillin.git


  * And for compile:

        * Enter to the Daredevil kernel directory 

        $ ./dd

  * The kernel file (called zImage, will be found in arch/arm/boot folder)


# Important Notice:

        * The Daredevil Kernel is already implemented on my Unofficial lineage os builds

        * The OFFICIAL linux 3.x readme can be found on the Documentation folder

        * If you use this kernel for your custom roms, please atach the git contributors and put me on the credit section
